# The Salt Minion can redirect all file server operations to a local directory,
# this allows for the same state tree that is on the master to be used if
# coppied completely onto the minion. This is a literal copy of the settings on
# the master but used to reference a local directory on the minion.

# Set the file client, the client defaults to looking on the master server for
# files, but can be directed to look at the local file directory setting 
# defined below by setting it to local.
